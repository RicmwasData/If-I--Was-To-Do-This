# If I Was to Do This  

## 📖 About  
**If I Was to Do This** is a collection of interviews focused on practical applications in data science and analysis. Each entry features an interview conducted by someone else, along with my breakdown of how it was structured and what insights were gained. I then reimagine how I would have approached the interview—refining the questions, adjusting the focus, and exploring different angles to make it even more impactful.  

The goal is to analyze and enhance interview techniques while deepening discussions around real-world data science and analytics challenges.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
- To study and refine interview techniques in data science and analytics.  
- To explore how different approaches can lead to more insightful conversations.  
- To provide an alternative take on industry interviews, focusing on clarity, depth, and engagement.  
- To build a resource for those looking to improve their interviewing skills or gain better insights from discussions.
